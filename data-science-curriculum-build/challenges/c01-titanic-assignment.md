*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

``` r
df_titanic <- as_tibble(Titanic)
```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1s…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female",…
    ## $ Age      <chr> "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child"…
    ## $ Survived <chr> "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "…
    ## $ n        <dbl> 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 118, 154, 387, 670, 4, 13, 89, 3, 5…

**Observations**:

- Class
- Sex
- Age
- Survived
- n

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here
- Are there any differences?
  - Wikipedia estimates that there were 2224 people aboard
  - According to our dataset, there were 2201 people onboard
- If yes, what might account for those differences?
  - This is a difference of 23 people. Most likely, our dataset and
    Wikipedia are referencing different records. It’s possible there are
    people who bought tickets, but didn’t end up making it on board. Or
    there could be stowaways on board the ship. Or passengers who died
    but were not found, and didn’t have relatives or a record of their
    voyage.

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
survived_q3 <-
  df_titanic %>% 
  filter(Survived == 'Yes')

survived_q3 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Class, n, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col()
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Among passengers of 1st and 2nd class, significantly more women than
  men survived the sinking. In 3rd class there were also more female
  than male survivors, but by a substantially smaller margin.
- Crew members are the only exception to this, where more male
  crewmembers survived than any other demographic. Its possible that
  this deviation from the trend is due to there being more male than
  female crew on the ship.
- A larger number of 1st class passengers survived, compared to 2nd and
  3rd classes. 2nd class had the fewest survivors of any group.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # ℹ 22 more rows

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

``` r
df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == 'Yes') %>%
  ggplot(aes(Class, Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here.
  - This feels like the data I wanted from the previous plot!
  - Proportionally more women survived than men, regardless of class or
    crew status.
  - It seems that there is a relationship between higher class and
    higher proportion of survivors, but I’m not sure if I trust the data
    to be displaying that accurately.
- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
  - What is the y axis here? I typically expect a proportion to show a
    fraction of a total, so no group should have a segment in the column
    that is greater than 1.
  - Looking through the raw data from the provided filter step, it seems
    that we are calculating proportion of adult and child survivors of
    each demographic, then adding them together, which results in a
    maximum proportion of 2 for each category. This is super misleading,
    as there are significantly fewer children than adults in the data
    set, and the proportion of child survivors is generally much higher
    than adults. This gives a super disproportionate weighting in the
    bar graph format. I take it back, this isn’t the data I wanted.

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables!

``` r
df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == 'Yes') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Class, Prop, fill = Age)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(rows = 'Sex')
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- This data seems much more predictable than past plots.
- All 1st and 2nd class children survived. In third class, a higher
  proportion of male children than adults survived, but for women it was
  roughly equal.
- Male adults had the lowest survival rate of any group. Where the first
  graph showed the highest number of male crewmembers surviving, the
  actual proportion is less than 1/4.
- Women had relatively high survival rates. Nearly all 1st class and
  crew women survived, but survival rate among women was progressively
  lower for lower classes. Interstingly, this trend of lower survival in
  lower classes didn’t hold true for men, where 1st class had the
  highest proportion of male survivors, followed by 3rd followed by 2nd.
- If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain
  the fishy-ness.
  - The proportions are all normalized out of 1, now. This plot
    distinguishes between adults and children. At least at the current
    level of detail, it no longer seems fishy to me.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
