```

## Covid Birth Comparison

Pull CDC wonder data

```{r pull-births}
# Load necessary library
library(readxl)
birth <- "./data/covid_birth_data.xlsx"
# Read the dataset
df_births <- read_excel(birth, sheet = 1)

# Remove rows where any column contains "Total"
df_births_cleaned <- 
  df_births[!apply(df, 1, function(row) any(grepl("Total", row, ignore.case = TRUE))), ]

# Display the filtered dataset
head(df_births_cleaned)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
